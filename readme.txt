I added a unique key to Item code in item table because the item code should be unique

I finished task 1 2 and in task 3 I wrote all the join queries and it works fine but I was unable to 
filter the data.



setup sets : 

step 1 :
 copy and paste all the flies and folders in this folder into your webserver public folder or localserver htdocs

step 2 : 

 create a database named assign

step 3 : 

 inside the sql files folder there is a sql file, please import it inside the assign database.

thats it.
